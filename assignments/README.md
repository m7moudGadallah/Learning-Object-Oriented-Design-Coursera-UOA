## Capstone Assignment 1.1 – UML Class Diagram

> Given: this [code base](./week2/capstone_assignment_materials/Y_n_-28dR8K5__tvHdfCzA_fde608d7579b432ba1e11f4ef4ac5393_SharingApp-c1-items-only-v4.zip)

### How to create your assignment

**(1) Become familiar with the code:**

In its current state, a user of the app—the owner—is able to record the items they own and wish to share.

The owner may view all of their items, their “Available” items, or their “Borrowed” items.

The owner may change the status of an item they own from “Available” to “Borrowed” and back.

When an item’s status is changed to “Borrowed”, the owner must enter the username of the borrower.

Review the user stories, then download, examine, and run the code base provided.

**(2) Construct a diagram:**

After you have become familiar with the code, construct a UML class diagram that captures the following six classes and three types of relationships in the code base. For each class, you should document all attributes and methods.

The six classes are:

- AppCompatActivity
- AddItemActivity
- EditItemActivity
- ItemList
- Item
- Dimensions

The three types of relationships are:

- Aggregation
- Composition
- Inheritance
